# Twitter Scraper Using SNScraper Python Package

Since Twitter API is only limited getting to last 7 days data, getting past history tweets is getting harder.

These are some examples of SNScraper, a Python Plugin to scrape historical tweets. I was able to get data from 2020
1. jack.csv -> getting last 100 tweets from user @jack
2. elephant -> getting 500 tweets about "elephant" between June 2020 and July 2020
